Snapp!
=========================

A Snapp app is Sepehr Sadri's project assignment for applying as an android developer position at Snapp.


Introduction
------------

The application uses Clean Architecture based on MVVM + Clean.

The application is written entirely in Kotlin.

Android Jetpack is used as an Architecture glue including but not limited to ViewModel, LiveData,
Lifecycles, Navigation, Room. See a complete list in "Libraries used" section.

The application does network HTTP requests via Retrofit, OkHttp and GSON. Loaded data is saved to
SQL based database Room, which serves as single source of truth and support offline mode.

Kotlin Coroutines manage background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.

Navigation component manages in-app navigation.

Dagger 2 is used for dependency injection.

A sample app consist of 3 screens: Map Screen, Permission screen and List of Vehicles.

  * ViewModel - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * Material - Material Components.
* Third party
  * Kotlin Coroutines - for managing background threads with simplified code
     and reducing needs for callbacks.
